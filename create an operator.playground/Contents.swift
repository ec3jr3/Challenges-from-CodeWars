/*
 There isn't yet an operator for Swift that returns true if one number is about the same as the other.

 Your job is to create an operator ?= that works for Ints, Doubles, and Floats, and returns true if the first number is within 10% of the second one.

 Examples

 100 ?= 95   // true
 30  ?= 32   // true
 67  ?= 1    // false
 89  ?= 100  // false
 110 ?= 100  // true
